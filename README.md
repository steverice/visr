# VISR

VISR is a native port of Halo: Combat Evolved to Apple Vision Pro, built from
the Halo: CE decompilation and compiled for ARM64 with a Metal renderer, not an
emulator. The goal is the best possible, best-optimized Halo on Vision Pro,
true to the original game. The same app also runs on iPhone, iPad, Apple TV and
the Mac.

VISR ships no game data. You need a disc image of the original Xbox game, made
from your own disc. VISR is an unofficial fan project, not affiliated with or
endorsed by Microsoft, Halo Studios or Bungie. See [Legal](#legal).

## VR

- Full stereo VR with head tracking, through Compositor Services
- Foveated rendering through the Compositor's rate maps
- The HUD in CE's own corners, out in the periphery, following the body's turn
  rather than the head
- Scope zoom fills the view
- Third-person cutscenes on a 3D screen in the room

VISR also plays in 2D, in a window or on a virtual screen in the room (theater
mode). A game controller is required.

Settings live in `config.toml` in the VISR folder in Files. The
[roadmap](#roadmap) names the setting behind each feature, and
[port/ios/README.md](port/ios/README.md) describes the display and renderer
settings.

## Get the app

There are no releases. Each run of the [iOS workflow](https://github.com/steverice/visr/actions/workflows/ios.yml)
uploads unsigned IPAs as artifacts: `visr-visionos-unsigned` for Apple Vision
Pro, `visr-ios-unsigned` and `visr-tvos-unsigned` for the others. GitHub keeps
them for 14 days. Sign one with your own Apple account
([AltStore](https://faq.altstore.io/) and [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/faq)
have guides), or build from source. Keep the same bundle ID when you update,
and your saves carry over.

The app reserves a 4 GB address range for the game's 32-bit memory at launch.
If a Vision Pro refuses it, launching shows "Could not reserve the game's 4 GB
memory arena". Build with `--extended-virtual-addressing`, which needs a paid
developer team.

## Game data

You need a disc image (`.iso` or `.xiso`) of the original Xbox release:

- NTSC-US, map build `01.10.12.2276`
- PAL, map build `01.01.14.2342`

PC, Custom Edition and Master Chief Collection files do not work.

Open VISR, tap **Choose XISO** and pick the image in Files, or copy one image
into the VISR folder before launching. The importer checks the image's file
system, map build and campaign maps before it copies anything, then extracts
the maps and starts the game. Later launches go straight to the game, and you
can delete the image. Saves live in the `save` folder inside the VISR folder;
back it up before you delete the app.

## Build from source

You need an Apple silicon Mac with Xcode, Python 3 and Homebrew. The validated
toolchain is Xcode 27 with Homebrew LLVM and LLD 23.1.2. Add your Apple account
in Xcode > Settings > Accounts before a signed build.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/steverice/visr.git
cd visr
brew install cmake ninja llvm lld sdl3 pkgconf

# Regression tests
python3 tools/ios_test.py

# Apple Vision Pro: signed, unsigned IPA, simulator
python3 tools/ios_build.py --visionos --team YOUR_TEAM_ID --bundle-id com.yourname.visr.vision
python3 tools/ios_build.py --visionos --unsigned --ipa dist/VISR-visionOS-unsigned.ipa
python3 tools/ios_build.py --visionos --simulator

# iPhone and iPad, Apple TV, Mac
python3 tools/ios_build.py --team YOUR_TEAM_ID --bundle-id com.yourname.visr
python3 tools/ios_build.py --tvos --team YOUR_TEAM_ID --bundle-id com.yourname.visr.tv
python3 tools/ios_build.py --mac
```

The build script downloads SDL, musl and the Khronos headers itself. The
[build and install guide](port/ios/README.md) covers installing from the
command line, the simulator, display and renderer settings, the
[Apple Vision Pro build](port/ios/README.md#apple-vision-pro) and
troubleshooting.

## Roadmap

### VR

- [x] Stereo with head tracking through Compositor Services (`display.stereo = "head"`)
- [x] Stick turning: snap (default), smooth or off, with an optional comfort vignette (`input.turn`, `input.snap_angle`, `input.smooth_turn_speed`, `input.comfort_vignette`)
- [x] Foveated rendering through the Compositor's rate maps, on by default (`display.foveation`)
- [ ] A default render quality chosen from a headset sweep (`display.render_quality`)
- [x] The HUD split by what draws each piece, with the crosshair on its own layer
- [x] The HUD in the periphery, in CE's own corners, turning with the body only (`display.hud_scale`, `display.hud_resolution`)
- [x] Scope zoom fills the view
- [x] Cutscenes as a 3D film on a 16:9 screen, opening out to the world at the end
- [x] Vehicles stay immersive in third person
- [x] The paused scene stays fixed in the room, and menus get their own layer
- [x] The sky at infinity in each eye, and mirror reflections per eye
- [x] Model detail chosen for the headset's pixels (`display.model_lod`)
- [x] A separate random seed for rendering, so render settings don't change the game
- [x] The first-person weapon lowered for the headset's taller view
- [x] The first-person body drawn below the view (`display.first_person_body_offset`)
- [ ] The first-person body in vehicle seats, and depth clamping on the body
- [ ] Immersive cutscenes, with the scene outside the director's frame blurred
- [x] Stereo on the theater screen, as a 3D TV (`display.stereo = "screen"`)
- [x] 2D play in a window at the window's resolution
- [x] 2D play on a screen in your room on visionOS 26 (`display.immersive`, `display.theater_width`, `display.theater_distance`, `display.theater_environment`)

### Controls

- [x] Any game controller, plus keyboard navigation in the menus
- [ ] Aiming with tracked PlayStation VR2 Sense controllers: first-person seats aim with the hand, third-person seats with the stick
- [ ] The game's rumble on the Sense controllers
- [ ] Aim assist and magnetism kept for hand aiming, tunable in single player and fixed in multiplayer

### Performance

- [x] CPU savings in the Metal draw path, and visibility tests that don't wait for the GPU
- [x] Relaxed-math pixel shaders
- [x] The Compositor paces stereo frames (`display.frame_repeat`)
- [x] Shader and pipeline warm-up at map load
- [ ] A recent render-target cache (a port of upstream's `197c1994`)

### Graphics

- [x] Rendering at the display's native resolution, with MetalFX upscaling (`display.upscaler`, `display.render_scale`)
- [x] Compressed textures, 16x anisotropic filtering and reversed-Z depth
- [x] Upstream's redrawn high-resolution HUD and text
- [x] Anti-aliasing (FXAA, SMAA, MSAA, SSAA), shadow resolution and per-pixel lighting (`display.anti_aliasing`, `display.shadow_resolution`, `display.per_pixel_lighting`)
- [ ] Mirror reflections at full resolution by default (`display.mirror_resolution`)
- [ ] AI-upscaled textures
- [ ] Bink intro and attract videos

### Multiplayer

- [x] Split-screen co-op, LAN play, and internet play with a server browser, from OpenCE (`network.online`)
- [x] `halo://join` invite links on every Apple platform
- [x] A grace period that keeps a network game running while the app is in the background
- [ ] LAN discovery over Bonjour
- [ ] Sharing the host's invite from the app
- [ ] Internet play on by default

### App

- [ ] An in-game settings screen for these options

## Repository layout

- `source/` is the decompiled game, from the upstream decompilation projects
- `port/runtime` is the portable runtime for the game's 32-bit pointers on
  ARM64
- `port/ios` is the Apple app: UIKit, touch controls, audio, the loader, the
  disc importer, the Metal renderer and the visionOS scenes
- `port/linux` holds the platform layer, the OpenGL renderer and the Xbox
  compatibility layer shared with the upstream desktop ports, which still
  build from this tree (see [README.upstream.md](README.upstream.md))
- `tools/` has the build, packaging and test scripts

## Reporting bugs and contributing

[Open an issue](https://github.com/steverice/visr/issues) with your device, OS
version, the app's version and what you were doing. `ios-runtime.log` and
`debug.txt` in the VISR folder help; skim them for anything personal first, and
do not attach game files or disc images. Security problems go through
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and the
[code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
