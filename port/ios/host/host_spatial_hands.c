from, because the thumb is sitting on it, so the tip goes missing on the sample after the
press and the carry answers "still where it was, which is on the thumb" for the whole
dropout. For a finger genuinely away from the thumb and merely out of view that is the right
answer and the carry stays. For a finger the thumb is on it cannot be: the state being
measured is what causes the occlusion, so the carry can never notice the fingers parting, and
on device a tap meant as one shot became a held trigger for as long as 2.3 s.

So while a fingertip cannot be measured, the pinch is judged instead by the pair of joints
behind the contact point that the thumb is not sitting on, against what that pair measured
while the tips were last seen (part_reference_record). Returns 1 when the carry may not be
trusted this sample, which releases a closed pinch and keeps an already-released one open: a
pinch is never closed again by a position carried from a pose the pair says the hand has
left. There is no clock in any of it, which is what lets a pinch be held for as long as the
player holds it (hands_probe.c's pinch_hold_to_fire_never_releases): the confirmation below
counts consecutive samples past the margin and resets on the first one inside it, so nothing
here accumulates with the length of a hold.

Which joints, and how far they have to grow, are the two things a device session corrected.
The first version watched the finger's middle knuckle, which barely translates when a pinch
opens, and asked for 12 mm of growth from it: over a whole session it released one pinch,
and every other release waited for the hidden fingertip exactly as it had before the check
existed. Both halves of that are fixed here, the joints in part_pair_of and the margin in

		reads as slow: a player's comfortable vertical reach is a fraction of their sideways

		input.hand_elevation_deadzone and input.hand_elevation_span arrive here instead,
		defaulting to 9 and 14, which puts the gun at its stop 23 degrees up. The division is
		safe at either documented end of the span and past them: an excess over a span of 0 is
		an infinity clampf pins to 0 or 1, and a 0 over 0 is the NaN its guard answers with 0.

		The sign is positive upward and that is the whole point of it: controls[g].stick_y

		raising the arm raises the gun, and lowering it lowers it, with no sign flip anywhere
		between.

		input.aim_pitch_offset is subtracted before the deadzone and the ramp ever see it: it
		is the same downward correction controller_aim_game.c reads into pitch_offset_degrees
		and hands to controller_aim.c's controller_location_to_world, which rotates the aim
		forward about the location's left axis (forward toward -up, positive down) before the
		guest ever draws a sightline from it. This file has only the forward component, not
		the hand's up or left, but it does not need them: aim_up (host_spatial_hands.m) builds
		that up as the room's up squared off against this same forward, which puts forward and
		up in the one vertical plane that also holds the room's vertical and this forward's
		heading. Turning forward toward -up by an angle theta inside that plane is turning its
		elevation from phi to phi - theta while its horizontal direction keeps the same heading,
		scaled by cos(phi - theta) rather than flipped, for any arm pose this recognizer ever
		sees. So subtracting degrees from the elevation this file already measures is the same
		rotation controller_location_to_world does, without carrying the up vector through this

	the aim, a player may legitimately set it to 0, and the prayer sign silently stopping
	working because of it is a coupling nobody would look for.
