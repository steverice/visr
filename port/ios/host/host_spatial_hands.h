/* a pinch's hysteresis: closes below CLOSE, opens above OPEN and holds whatever it had in
between. Both are fractions of a ruler measured from the player's own hand rather than
absolute meters, because a session of raw distances (debug.hand_distance_log, whose line is
host_spatial_hands.m's periodic log) finally said where the two absolute numbers were sitting,
and it was inside the wrong distribution. For the aiming hand, 3690 samples:

	a deliberate pinch, n=417:   min 0.0010  25th 0.0051  median 0.0071  75th 0.0094
	                             95th 0.0206  max 0.0287
	a resting hand,     n=1236:  min 0.0183  5th 0.0242  25th 0.0319  median 0.0391
	                             75th 0.0474  95th 0.0655  max 0.1110

The old CLOSE of 0.018 sat a fifth of a millimeter under that resting minimum, so a merely
relaxed hand reached it and fired, and the old OPEN of 0.030 sat inside the resting lower
quartile, so a tap's release waited while the hand settled on top of it. Five rounds of work
read that second number as a fault in the release rules and tuned those instead (the carry's
deadline, the joints part_pair_of watches, the growth part_decide asks for): the rules were
answering correctly about a threshold in the wrong place.

The ruler is a per-finger measure so the thresholds scale with the player's own fingers, which
is what a joint radius would do if ARKit reported one. It does not: "radius" appears nowhere in
the XROS 27 ARKit headers, and ar_hand_skeleton_get_joint_named hands back a joint with a
transform and a tracked flag and nothing about its size. So the stand-in is the finger's distal
segment, its intermediate tip to its own tip, which the same session measured at 0.0224 for the
index finger with a spread under 1 mm across the whole of it: the steadier of the two rulers
that session logged (palm width varied by about 2 mm), and per-finger where palm width is one
number for the hand.

Two thirds of that segment for CLOSE and one whole segment for OPEN puts this player's band at
0.0149 and 0.0224, which is the clear air between his two distributions: CLOSE 3.4 mm below the
resting minimum of 0.0183, so no relaxed hand reaches it, and OPEN 1.8 mm above the pinching
95th percentile of 0.0206, so no held pinch drifts over it. A bigger hand's band scales with its
own fingers rather than keeping this one's millimeters */

which varies by player and by finger and cannot be known in advance, so the reference
is recorded live on every sample the tips themselves can be measured

Half of it re-arms the carry (hands_pinch's parted), so a pair hovering at the margin
cannot chatter the trigger.

5 mm is provisional, and it is deliberately low: the first value here was 12 mm,
reasoned from the length of a proximal phalanx and the angle it swings through, and a
whole device session released one pinch by this path. Every other release waited for the
hidden fingertip to come back, which is the defect the check exists to fix. So the
number stops being argued and starts being measured: HANDS_EVENT_PART_GROWTH below
reports the pair's growth at every release the fingertips themselves decided, whatever
that growth was, so one session of ordinary taps and holds gives the distribution of
growths at a release the player meant. This constant becomes the low end of that
distribution, with the jitter floor the same session shows under it. Until then 5 mm is

against. One sample would not be: a single noisy reading past the margin sets
hands_pinch's parted, and parted does not clear again until the growth falls under half
the margin or the fingertips can be measured again, neither of which a hand that is
still pinching with the tip hidden will do. So one spike does not cost a sample of
trigger, it costs the rest of the hold, and at 90 Hz a hold of a few seconds is
thousands of chances to take that spike. Requiring the parting twice running makes a
false release need two spikes in a row, while a real parting only grows further on the

18 + 27 = 45 degrees of arm.

The turn's alone. The arm's elevation shared this span and input.hand_turn_deadzone with it
when the vertical axis was added, on the reasoning that one arm swinging through one range
should feel alike on both axes of the one stick, with the note that they should be split once
a device session said otherwise. It said otherwise: the turn is liked as it is and the
elevation reads as slow, because 18 + 27 asks for the arm 45 degrees above its corrected zero
for a full deflection and nobody's comfortable vertical reach is as long as their sideways
sweep. So the elevation takes input.hand_elevation_deadzone and input.hand_elevation_span

finger's end steps down and the thumb's end steps along, most distal first. A pinch puts the
thumb's pad on the fingertip, so the contact point is exactly what the cameras lose, and
every level here is a pair the thumb is not sitting on.

The finger's end is named first because it is the end that has to move. A finger opening out
of a pinch rotates almost entirely about its own two outer joints: the fingertip travels
centimeters, the joint right behind it nearly as far, and the middle knuckle (the
intermediate base) barely translates at all. A device session that watched the middle
knuckle released one pinch in the whole session, which is what the finger's intermediate tip
is here to fix: it sits a bone behind the contact point, out of the thumb's shadow, and
still travels with the tip. Below it the ladder gives up signal for visibility, the
intermediate base first and the knuckle last, since a pair taken off the knuckle can only
just tell a pinch from an open hand and is the last thing worth asking.

The thumb's end steps from its intermediate tip to its intermediate base within each of the
finger's: the finger's distal phalanx wraps over the thumb's pad, so the thumb's
intermediate tip is the first joint of the two at risk, while its intermediate base sits on
the outside of the hand. Stepping the thumb before the finger is on purpose, since losing
the thumb's more distal joint costs far less of the pair's travel than giving up the
finger's.

the complaint stayed the same, that a quick tap becomes a hold, and nothing in this file ever
reported the duration being complained about. So one line comes out of every release, on
every path that can release a pinch: its value is how many seconds that pinch had been
closed, and its own path is the release's, so a session of ordinary play sorts into how long
a tap really lasts and which reading ended it. Its threshold is 0, as PINCH_MISS's is and for

gate did, so a refusal prints a constant threshold against an unrelated quantity and names
nothing: a device session of seven failed attempts showed the gate going on and off with the
dot either side of the same numbers and no way to tell which term moved.

So this line carries the first term that refuses, in `finger` (HANDS_PRAYER_GATE_*), with that

refusing and 0 when nothing is refusing any more, and it is emitted only when which term is

measurements of this hand's own size, logged so that a session could say which of them was
steady enough to put the pinch hysteresis in a fraction of, rather than in an absolute
distance that fits one player's hand and not another's. index_distal won that comparison and
is now the ruler (HANDS_PINCH_CLOSE_RULER_FRACTION above), measured per finger rather than for
the index alone; both stay logged, since palm width is what says the hand is being seen at the
right scale at all. Both read straight off the joints with no carry of their own, since

/* One hand's aim through a dropout: whether this sample's aim is the hand's own reading, the
last one held over, or nothing at all. Plain C and no ARKit, so hands_probe.c can check the
three answers; host_spatial_hands.m's hand_of keeps the pose and does the holding.

Why a hold here at all. The aim had none: the first sample in which the hand anchor, its
skeleton or its wrist joint is missing used to reach the guest as HALO_SPATIAL_UNTRACKED,
where the pinches on the same hand already got HANDS_HAND_GAP_SECONDS to ride the same blink
out. That asymmetry is expensive out of all proportion to the blink, because of what the
guest does with a loss rather than anything here: a recovery is gated on a dwell that
lengthens with every loss soon after the last, and the aim keeps easing toward the head for
as long as that dwell makes it wait. Measured in port/ios/tests/controller_aim_probe.c's
brief_loss_reaches_the_head: by the third loss inside five seconds the dwell is a whole
second, and a dropout of a single sample costs about 300 ms of head aim and a 200 ms ease
back, which is the snap a player sees and reports.

So a blink shorter than the gap never reaches the guest at all, and the dwell never starts
climbing. That is the property worth having, and it does not depend on knowing the blink
lengths in advance: whatever they are, the ones inside the gap cost nothing, and a hand
genuinely gone for longer still hands the aim over on the sample the gap runs out, exactly as
it did before this existed.

readable is 1 on a sample this hand's own joints could build an aim from, which is the only
thing that ends a run. gap_seconds is input.hand_aim_gap, already clamped by the caller.
HELD needs a pose to hold, so the first unreadable samples of a session are LOST however the
rest of this is set (hold->known).

loss_mode is input.hand_aim_loss, and it decides what happens once a run passes the gap.
HANDS_AIM_LOSS_HEAD gives the aim up there, which is what the gap above was built to do.
HANDS_AIM_LOSS_HOLD, the default for bare hands, never gives it up: a hand out of view keeps
pointing where it last pointed for as long as it is out of view, and the head never takes the
aim from a hand at all.

Why holding is the default. The gap made brief dropouts free, and a device session with it
still read as better rather than fixed: the head taking the aim remained the one thing in
play that broke aiming outright, because it does not merely lag the aim, it moves it somewhere
else and then moves it back. A frozen aim is legible (the gun stops following the hand, and
the player waits or lowers and raises the hand) where a hand-off is not. So the choice is the
player's and it is held, with HEAD kept because it is a real preference and because every
reason the gap exists still applies to anyone who wants it.

What holding does not do: it cannot keep the aim when hand tracking itself goes away rather
than a hand going out of view. A provider that stops, a permission withdrawn and a session
that ends all reach the guest as a sample that is not READY, which is a lost hand on the
guest's own side (controller_aim_game.c), and host_spatial_hands_idle clears the hold with it.
That path is deliberately left alone: a player whose hand tracking has died needs the head
back, or there is no aiming at all and nothing to recover with.

hold->past_gap is for the log alone and no decision reads it: 1 once the current run has
passed gap_seconds, whichever mode is set, so a session still sorts the dropouts the gap would
have absorbed from the ones it would not and the setting can still be sized from a hold-mode
session (host_spatial_hands.m's log_aim_condition) */

Every position this file's callers hand out is an offset from the head, so a sample taken with
no head has no position to give: subtracting nothing leaves the room's own coordinates, which
are a different quantity in the same units and read as a hand a metre or more from where it
is. The stereo side latches the head only while the head drives the view, so on the screen
(the menus, a cinematic, a level load) and on any frame the compositor refuses there is no
latch at all, while the hand anchors keep arriving and the gestures keep being read from them.
That is the sample this exists for.

A head that was latched is remembered and given back for those samples, which bounds the error
at the player's own movement since the last latch rather than at their distance from the
room's origin. Before the first latch of a run there is nothing to remember and this answers
NULL, which is the caller's signal that no position can be expressed at all this sample: the
hand reaches the guest orientation-only (host_spatial_hands.m's hand_of). NULL rather than a
zero vector on purpose, since a zero vector is a legal head position and is the one that
caused this.

was; the vector returned is this hold's own copy and stays valid until the next call */
