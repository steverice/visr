/* Bare hands for hand aim (input.aim = "hands"): the second source of the
same struct halo_spatial_hand the PlayStation VR2 Sense controllers fill
(host_spatial.m, halo_spatial.h). Everything downstream is unchanged -- the
sightline, the IK arms, the laser and the reticle all read hands[aiming_hand]
and never ask where it came from (controller_aim_game.c).

Two samples, the same two host_spatial.m takes. The game sample reads the
provider's latest anchors; the drawing sample (host_spatial_hands_frame,
inside host_stereo_frame) queries both anchors at the drawable's
trackable-anchor time, the instant the Sense tracker predicts its own
controllers to, and holds them for the drawing sample that follows in the
same frame.

ARKit is read on the game thread only. The permission's handler runs on an
arbitrary queue and the provider's update handler on this file's own serial
queue, and neither touches anything but the locked queue of changes the game
thread drains, exactly as host_spatial.m's header describes. The update
handler is empty: routine anchor updates are off without one, and the samples
fill the two anchors themselves. Those two anchors are made once, because the
provider fills anchors the caller owns rather than handing out a collection.

A hand anchor carries a skeleton whose joints hang off the wrist, not an aim
location, so the aim is built rather than read: its position is the wrist,
its barrel the forearm's direction (the wrist less the forearm's arm joint)
and its up the room's up squared off against that barrel, as a room transform
that host_spatial_location turns into the room's level frame exactly as it
turns a controller's aim location (host_spatial_pose.h). Nothing of the
hand's own orientation reaches the aim, which is what keeps the gun upright
under a hand that rolls freely about the forearm it is aiming with.
The game sample also runs the gesture recognizer (host_spatial_hands.c,
plain C over the reduced joints below) and host_spatial_gamepad_map onto the
same virtual gamepad the Sense pair fills; it marks itself gamepad_valid 2,
which marks the sample as the hands source's. xinput_sdl.c merges that into
port 0 like a Sense sample and remaps it differently in menus.

Hands sit outside host_spatial.m's visionOS 27 gates. Accessory tracking is
only complete in the 27 SDK (HOST_SPATIAL_SENSE_SDK) and the Sense tracker is
gated on it twice over; hand tracking and the rendering-corrected transform
getters are visionOS 1.0 and 2.0 API, so this file needs neither gate and
runs wherever the immersive path does (@available(visionOS 26.0, *), as
host_theater.m). */

Why the fault is recorded at all: hand_of refuses a sample for three separate
reasons and every one of them reaches the guest as the same untracked hand,
so a session of dropouts could be counted but not diagnosed. The fixes are
different for each, which is the point of telling them apart.

Why the wrist's flag is recorded although nothing refuses a sample on it any
more: it counts what dropping that refusal recovered, and on a sample the
anchor itself refused the skeleton is still there to ask, so a hand ARKit
calls untracked that still reports a tracked wrist would say the anchor's flag
can be read as advice rather than as an answer. Nothing decides on that yet;
it is a count the next session produces.

Why the fidelity: it is the only thing in the hand tracking API that is not a
boolean (hand_tracking.h's ar_hand_fidelity, visionOS 26), so it is the only
field that can say a hand was being read poorly before it was lost rather
than merely that it was lost. visionOS 2.0 is the deployment target, so the

/* debug.hand_distance_log: one line per hand, roughly ten times a second
(HAND_DISTANCE_LOG_SAMPLES above). Four decimals on every distance: three gives 1 mm bins,
too coarse to tell a resting hand from a deliberate pinch apart, which is the whole reason
for this line (host_spatial_hands.h's HANDS_PINCH_CLOSE_RULER_FRACTION comment, which records
the distributions this line measured). Each
of the four pinches carries its distance, which of HANDS_DISTANCE_MEASURED/CARRIED/
UNAVAILABLE it is, and whether that pinch is closed right now, so a session's lines sort
into the resting and the pinching distributions without correlating against any other line.
Each pinch also carries the ruler its own band was scaled off on this sample
(host_spatial_hands.c's ruler_meters), because a distance means nothing without the threshold
it was judged against and every finger's threshold is its own. It is the field that says
whether a finger's window is working: HANDS_RULER_MINIMUM_METERS is 10 mm and a small little
finger's distal segment is about that, so such a finger has every reading of it dropped by
ruler_push and keeps HANDS_RULER_DEFAULT_METERS forever, which puts its pinch at roughly twice
the distance it should be. Exactly 0.0224 in this field is that case, since a median of real
readings does not land on the default.

palm_width and index_distal close the line: two measures of this hand's own size, "unavailable"
rather than a number on a sample ARKit doesn't give them, since the question this line was added
to answer was whether the two thresholds belong in a fraction of one of these rather than in an
absolute distance. They do, and the distal segment is the one they are in now
(host_spatial_hands.c's ruler_meters); both stay on the line, palm width because it is what
says the hand is being seen at the right scale at all. index_distal is the index finger's raw
segment where the ruler fields above are each finger's own smoothed window, so the two are not
the same number and neither replaces the other.

Greppable on "hands: distance ", and every field after the side is in a fixed column, so an
awk invocation can pull any of them by number without parsing the line. The ruler field adds
one column to each finger's group, so a reader counting columns from an earlier session's

/* debug.hand_log: one line per change in what a hand's aim is being built from, with how long
the run that just ended had lasted. Three conditions, following hand_of's own three outcomes:

	measured  the anchor and the forearm are both ARKit's reading, so the barrel is this
	          sample's own and the aim reaches the guest HALO_SPATIAL_TRACKED. A forearm
	          tracked but shorter than FOREARM_MINIMUM_METERS reads as measured here and is
	          carried by hand_of, which is the one place the three names are not exactly its
	          outcomes: a degenerate length is a reading this line has no way to tell from a
	          sound one, and hand_of's own guard is what the number would be read against
	carried   the anchor is reported and the forearm is not, so the barrel is last_forward, a
	          direction frozen in the room from whenever the forearm was last seen. Still
	          TRACKED to the guest, which never learns the barrel is stale
	held      no anchor or no skeleton, but inside input.hand_aim_gap, so
	          hand_unreadable gives out the last whole pose and the guest is still told
	          TRACKED. Every one of these runs is a dropout the gap absorbed and the guest
	          never saw, which is what the gap is for and what sizing it needs counted
	held_past the same dropout once it has run past the gap, with input.hand_aim_loss = "hold"
	          still giving the pose out. Named apart from held for one reason: it is the split
	          the gap would have made, so a hold-mode session still says which dropouts a
	          head-mode player would have lost the aim to. One dropout therefore writes at most
	          held, then held_past, then its return, however long it lasts
	lost      the dropout past the gap with input.hand_aim_loss = "head", or a dropout with no
	          pose ever to hold in either mode, so the aim is zeroed and HALO_SPATIAL_UNTRACKED
	          and the guest's own grace and ease are all that hold the aim (controller_aim.c's
	          controller_track_update)

Why these four and not the anchor's flag alone: a player reports the gun occasionally
following the head and coming back, and the dropouts that could do it are different faults
with different fixes. A forearm-only drop freezes the barrel where it was and the guest sees
nothing wrong; a wrist or anchor drop reaching the guest is a loss, and there the cost is not
the dropout's length but the recovery dwell it triggers, which a hand dropping repeatedly
walks up to a whole second (port/ios/tests/controller_aim_probe.c's
brief_loss_reaches_the_head measures what that costs). Separating them is the point of the
line: it says which the player is actually hitting, how often, and for how long, and with the
gap in place it says how much of it the gap is already absorbing. A session whose dropouts end
on held says the gap absorbed all of them; dropouts going on to held_past (or, in head mode,
to lost) are the ones it did not, and their held_past runs are how much wider it would have to
be.

Transitions only, so an unbroken run writes nothing however long it lasts, where the per-hand
sample rate would be 90 lines a second. Greppable on "hands: aim " and every field after the
side is in a fixed column. host_logf and the guest's platform_log share stderr (host_main.m's
host_logf writes both it and the runtime log), so these lines and the guest's "controller aim:
hand lost" and "head aims %.3f s after the loss" sort into one stream and can be read against
each other.

Four fields close the line, all of them about the sample the new condition starts on, and all
of them appended rather than inserted so a reader counting columns from an earlier session's
lines finds the first nine where they were:

	fault     which of hand_of's three refusals this sample took: "anchor", "skeleton" or
	          "barrel", and "none" on a sample that was read. The condition alone cannot say
	          it, and the three have three different fixes, so a session of dropouts that was
	          countable is now diagnosable (aim_fault's own comment above)
	wrist     the wrist joint's own flag on this sample, "tracked" or "untracked", or "unknown"
	          where there was no skeleton to ask. Two pairs are worth counting. "fault none
	          wrist untracked" is a sample that was refused outright before the wrist's flag
	          stopped being a refusal, so the count is what that change recovered. "fault
	          anchor wrist tracked" would say a hand ARKit refuses still reports a wrist, and
	          so that the anchor's flag could be read as advice; nothing decides on it yet
	fidelity  the anchor's own, "nominal" or "high" (hand_tracking.h, visionOS 26), or
	          "unknown" below that API. The one non-boolean the hand API has, so the one field
	          that can say a hand was being read badly before it went rather than only after
	at        where the hand was when its wrist was last read, in the game's axes from the head
	          (meters, x forward, y left, z up: position_of). The device reads hands inside a
	          volume in front of it, and this port's aim pitch trim says the player holds the
	          gun low, so a session whose dropouts cluster at one offset is a posture problem
	          with a posture answer and not a code one. Without this field there is nothing in
	          the log that could tell those two apart
	from      what the three numbers above were measured from: "head", or "none" where no head
	          had been placed when the wrist was last read and they are therefore zeros and not
	          a reading. Appended after at so its own three columns stay where they were. The
	          first session to carry the at field read "none" as a position and reported hands
	          more than a metre above the head all through the menus (hands_head_hold) */
