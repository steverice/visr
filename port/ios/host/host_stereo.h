HUD's quads over both (host_stereo_hud.h), and presents the frame; the
game's command buffer, which drew them, is committed already. Brightness (0
to 1) dims both toward black, for the fade of a cut to or from the screen;
vignette (0 to 1) darkens the eyes' edges, not the HUD, for
input.comfort_vignette. hud_layers holds HOST_STEREO_HUD_LAYER_COUNT
textures (nil: nothing drew it this frame): the HUD layer, the crosshairs'
layer and each HUD group's target, with each group's rectangle in
hud_group_extent (gpu_stereo_present); without the HUD layer there's no HUD.
The HUD is laid out at hud_aspect's shape (its width over its height); with
hud_ui the HUD layer holds a menu, the console or a progress bar and
everything goes whole on the UI's quad; reticle is where the crosshair
points in the eyes' frame, and hud_tangents the HUD pass's projection, for
the catch-all quad. zoom (nil: none) is the zoomed picture, which shows in
place of the eyes' pictures over the whole view, on an opaque quad on the
HUD's plane zoom_tangents wide and tall, under the HUD's quads
(host_stereo_hud_zoom). While expanding (a cutscene's
film handing over to the full view, halo_stereo_window.h) the eyes show only
inside the window growing from the theater screen's rectangle at expansion
(0 to 1), black on the bars it carries (expansion_bars), with the theater's
surroundings and the script fade's tint (fade) outside it, and of the HUD
only a menu's UI quad. With cutscene (Task 12k's immersive cutscene,
halo_stereo_cutscene.h) the eyes are a cutscene camera turned by the head:
inside the director's frame (cutscene_forward and cutscene_up in the
device's frame at the render, cutscene_tangents its half tangents) they stay
sharp, outside they show a quarter-size blur of themselves, darkened and
desaturated by cutscene_dim, over a soft edge; the HUD layer goes whole on
the frame (a menu keeps the usual layout) */
