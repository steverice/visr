/* Head-tracked stereo (display.stereo = "head", visionOS 26 and later): the
Compositor's views drive the game's eyes, and the head drives its look.

At the game's frame begin, host_stereo_frame opens the Compositor's frame
(theater mode's, host_theater.m) and reads each view: its offset from the
device in meters, which becomes world units (one is 3.048 m), and its
frustum's tangents, recovered from the projection. The head's yaw and pitch
since the last frame turn the player's look (port/linux/game/stereo.c); its
roll only tilts the eye cameras. The game renders each eye, then
gpu_present_stereo (gpu_metal.m) hands the pictures here: each fills its view,
with the game's depth (already reverse-Z, gpu_metal.m's reversed_depth) for
the Compositor's reprojection, and the HUD's pieces float in front of it
(host_stereo_hud.h): the reticle where the crosshair points, the rest in
bands that turn with the head's yaw only, level with the room. A frame
without eyes (the main menu, a load) shows its picture on the UI's quad, the
same way.

Stereo on the theater screen (display.stereo = "screen") reads the same frame
for the eyes' positions only: the look stays on the stick, and screen_eyes
reports where the viewer's eyes are against the screen, from which the guest
maps the game as a 3D TV (stereo.c). host_theater_present_eyes puts each
eye's picture on the screen for its view.

Elsewhere host_stereo_frame leaves the frame mono. */
