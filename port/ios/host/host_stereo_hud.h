/* HEAD mode's HUD and UI layout (host_stereo.m): which of the HUD's layers
go where in the room. Plain C, so a host-side test can check it
(port/ios/tests/stereo_hud_probe.c).

The game draws its HUD laid out as always: 480 lines tall, its width the
window's shape (the HUD's aspect times 480), elements at the corners and the
center. In HEAD mode the guest splits it by the function that draws each
element (halo_stereo.h, the stereo spec's "The reticle split, by draw"):
the crosshairs into the reticle's layer, each HUD group (the weapon with
its grenades, the unit, the motion tracker, the prompts, the messages) into
a target of its own with the rectangle its draws cover, and everything else
into the HUD layer itself. Every one is laid out as the whole HUD. The
presenter puts:
- the reticle's layer whole, at its natural size, centered where the game's
  crosshair is (host_stereo_hud_reticle);
- each group's rectangle of its own target on a quad in the periphery, in
  the corner where CE puts it (the stereo spec's "The HUD in the
  periphery"), turning with the head's yaw only, level with the room: the
  weapon's counters (and a driver's seat labels) top left, the unit's
  meters top right, the motion tracker bottom left, the prompts and the
  messages top left under the counters. Each group's outer corner, its
  edge nearest that corner, sits at the display.hud_* settings' angles
  (struct host_stereo_hud_placement), so a wider element grows toward the
  center;
- the HUD layer whole, head-locked at the HUD pass's projection, the
  catch-all: nav points and the multiplayer score where the game projected
  them;
- while a menu, a help panel, the console or a progress bar drew (the
  guest's hud_ui), the guest's UI layer, which holds only those, whole on
  one level, yaw-following quad over the rest (the guest leaves the widgets'
  dim out of it, and the presenter darkens the eyes by it instead);
- while a frame has no eyes (the main menu, a load), or a menu is over the
  film, the HUD layer whole on that quad instead (host_stereo_present_ui). */
