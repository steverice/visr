/* Head-tracked stereo's look (port/linux/game/stereo.c with
port/ios/host/host_stereo_head.c), frame by frame as the game runs it:
the player's look takes in the head's turn, the next frame begins with the
head's new pose, and the render orients its camera. The world the camera
shows must stay put in the room: its up is the room's up, and its forward
doesn't move, while the head pans level at any pitch. A world that drifts
in roll while the head pans is the bug from headset session 1.

And the right stick's turn (input.turn): snaps by default, smooth turning at
input.smooth_turn_speed whatever the frame rate, none at all for "off", and
the comfort vignette's easing. stereo.c is included, not linked, so each
check can read the settings afresh.

And the film's (a cutscene on the screen): the mapping it shares with the
3D TV (halo_stereo_tv_eyes) puts infinity a share of the eye separation
behind the screen and the convergence distance on its surface, and the
held reason keeps the cutscene's framing through the hold; any script fade
over the picture covers the cut.

And a vehicle's third-person camera: the head turns the picture, relative
to its pose when the camera began (no jump on taking a seat), and never the
player's facing; the stick keeps the game's own turn and pitch. With
display.stereo_vehicle_screen the camera goes on the screen instead.

And the head's yaw at render time: paused (no look between frames) the eye
cameras still turn with the head, and the look takes the whole turn when it
runs again, without a jump; and with the game's camera blended between 30 Hz
ticks (render_interpolation.c), the eye cameras' yaw is the head's every
frame, plus the body's own.

And split screen (more than one player window): it keeps the mono path, as
render.c's eye loop does, so the frame has no eyes for any hook to take: no
head-driven look, no 3D film, no screen framing. */
