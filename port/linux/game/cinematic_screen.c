/*
CINEMATIC_SCREEN.C

What stereo's cutscene screen reads from the game (port/linux/src/halo_stereo.h):
whether the letterbox is in, which makes a cutscene the 3D film on a 16:9
screen (stereo.c); whether the camera is scripted or third person, which
make the film too (in SCREEN mode only the director's scripted camera); and
the script fade, which tints the immersive space around the screen
(port/ios/host/gpu_metal.m).

The letterbox, not cinematic_in_progress, marks the cutscene: the bars are
what frame Bungie's 16:9 composition, and scripts toggle them on their own
(cinematic_show_letterbox). Only script fades (fade_in, fade_out) tint the
room: the screen flashes of damage, pickups and telefrags stay on the game's
picture.
