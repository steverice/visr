/*
STEREO.C

The frame's stereo state (port/linux/src/halo_stereo.h): which stereo mode
display.stereo asks for, and, in stereo, where the two eyes are. In HEAD
mode the host's Compositor frame supplies the eyes and the head's turn
(port/ios/host/host_stereo.m), which drives the player's look: the head turns
the view, the right stick turns the body. In SCREEN mode the look stays the
stick's, as in mono, and the game is a 3D TV on the theater screen.

Everything on the screen is a 3D TV: the game's camera rendered twice, the
eyes a short way apart along its right at the camera itself (so the game's
own near plane and culling apply), with frusta skewed so a chosen distance
lies on the screen's surface. One mapping sets the depth of all of it
(screen_mapping_eyes, the stereo spec's "One mapping for the film and the
3D TV"): how far behind the screen infinity sits, as a share of the viewer's
eye separation, and the convergence, the distance ahead of the camera that
lies on the surface. The host reports the viewer's eyes against the screen
(host_stereo.m's screen_eyes); the guest takes from them only the eye
separation, the screen's half width and the head's offset, and maps them.

Cutscenes, in any stereo mode, are the 3D film while the letterbox is in
(halo_stereo_film), and so are moments with a director's scripted camera
(camera_control, the scripted perspective). In HEAD mode so is the
player's own camera while a script holds its look: a camera the head doesn't
steer is easier to watch on a screen. But in HEAD mode (and the side-by-side
view) only a camera that isn't first person goes on the film: a cutscene
stays immersive until its first such camera, then on the film until it ends
(the stereo spec's session 4 "Cutscenes"). A first-person camera without
the look (halo_look_disabled_first_person) turns its picture by the head, as
a third-person one does. At a cutscene's end the film holds until the camera
reaches the player's eyes, eases a second into a window onto the world (the
viewer's own eyes through the screen, portal_eyes), so it shows the world
where the full view will, then its rectangle expands out to the full view
(halo_stereo_window.h). HEAD mode asks the host for SCREEN
eyes meanwhile, so the frame is SCREEN for everyone downstream: the host
draws it on the screen, and the head's turn stays out of the look and the
camera. The film has display.film_depth_share and display.film_convergence,
and doesn't lean.

A third-person camera (a vehicle seat's chase camera) stays immersive in
HEAD mode: the head turns the game's camera for the picture only, relative
to its pose when the camera began, and never the player's facing, so the
sticks drive and aim as in mono (halo_stereo_head_orient). With
display.stereo_vehicle_screen it goes on the screen as the film instead.

SCREEN mode's gameplay is the same picture from the player's camera, with
display.screen_depth_share and display.screen_convergence, and the head's
offset from the screen's axis moves the eyes, as through a small window
(the lean). The first-person weapon has its own nearly flat mapping, its
nearest point on the screen's surface (halo_stereo_first_person_eye, for
rasterizer_set_frustum_z). In SCREEN mode the film's scripted reason counts
only the director's camera, so the player's own camera under a script and a
third-person camera stay gameplay; when the frame's mapping changes, it
eases over MAPPING_EASE_SECONDS rather than popping (no cut covers it).

The screen shows the game's horizontal view across 16:9: main.c narrows
the view by 0.75 while halo_stereo_screen_framing says so, which is the
letterbox's film (held through the film's hold) and, with
display.screen_framing = "band", everything in SCREEN mode. The letterbox
brings bars in for titles (cinematics.c), following the held film.
