/*
GPU.H

The interface between the Direct3D front end (d3d8_device.c, xbox_textures.c)
and a GPU backend (gpu_gl.c; Metal in Phase 1). It is filled in one
sub-step at a time (renderer split design, step 3).

It compiles on the 64-bit iOS host as well as in the 32-bit guest, so it
includes only <stdint.h> and gpu_uniforms.h (which includes nothing), and its
structs use fixed-width fields alone: the two ABIs lay them out the same way.
