/* The cutscene window's expansion in head-tracked stereo (stereo.c times
it; the presenter, port/ios/host/host_stereo.m, draws it). When a cutscene's
film hands over to the full view, the film's rectangle grows out to the
whole view over HALO_STEREO_EXPANSION_SECONDS, at the letterbox bars' own
rate (cinematics.c: one letterbox amount a second, linear), with the
picture inside it already the head-tracked view at the player's eyes.

The window is a rectangle of angles in the screen's frame (x right, y up, z
toward the viewer), about one eye: a direction d is inside when
atan2(d.x, -d.z) lies between its left and right and atan2(d.y, -d.z)
between its down and up. For directions toward the screen that is exactly
the screen's quad as the eye sees it, so the window begins as the film's
rectangle; it ends past the views' edges, or at +-pi (everything) when a
view looks away from the screen.

HALO_STEREO_WINDOW_SOURCE is written in the subset of C and the Metal
Shading Language both take (as host_stereo_vignette.h's mask): the eye
shader compiles it as text, and the probes and the side-by-side view's
debug screenshot run it as C. Its math functions are called as (atan2)(...)
so that no function-like macro rewrites them. */
